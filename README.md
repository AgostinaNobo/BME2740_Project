This project implements a simplified computational model of cardiac hemodynamics for BME 2740. The simulation represents the major components of the cardiovascular system through three progressively complex models: a systemic arteries isolation model, a left heart isolation model, and a full heart model that integrates the systemic and pulmonary circulations along with the left and right heart. Pressures, flows, and volumes were analyzed under normal physiological conditions as well as in the presence of common cardiovascular diseases. This project demonstrates fundamental modeling concepts such as ODE formulation and solution, parameter tuning, and validation against physiological expectations.
